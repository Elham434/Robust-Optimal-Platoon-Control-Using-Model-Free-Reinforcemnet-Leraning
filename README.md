ðŸš— Robust Optimal Platoon Control Using Model-Free Reinforcement Learning

This project presents a novel robust optimal control strategy for multi-vehicle platoons under unknown dynamics and disturbances.
Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods often depend on explicit vehicle models, but this work proposes a simplified, adaptive, off-policy, model-free RL algorithm that learns both optimal control an d disturbance compensation policies directly from input-output data, without requiring dynamic models.
The following video demonstrates the impact of reinforcement learning (RL)-based platooning control on traffic flow stability.
The first part shows a platoon without control, where vehicles decelerate and accelerate alternately, leading to traffic oscillations and stop-and-go phenomena. This instability increases travel time, energy     consumption, and the risk of collisions. 
The second part presents the same platoon under a reinforcement learning-based cooperative control strategy, where vehicles proactively adjust their speeds to maintain smooth and safe motion. 
Traffic oscillations are significantly suppressed, resulting in stable inter-vehicle distances, smoother traffic flow, and enhanced safety and efficiency.

Key contributions:

    Distributed Control: Each vehicle uses only local and neighboring information for decision-making.

    Optimality and Robustness: Solves a distributed Hamiltonâ€“Jacobiâ€“Bellman (HJB) equation to minimize tracking errors and attenuate disturbances.

    Model-Free RL: A fully data-driven, online learning method that identifies control policies and compensates unknown dynamics and disturbances.
    
    The simulation demonstrates the systemâ€™s ability to maintain safe distances and velocity synchronization among multiple vehicles even with modeling uncertainties and external disturbances.
